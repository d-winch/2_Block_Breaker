# 2_Block_Breaker
Arkanoid clone created using Unity 2D

The first non text based game I created in Unity.

Use the mouse to control the paddle, and click to fire the ball.

Power-ups include:

- Extra ball
- Longer paddle
- Sticky paddle (can cause an unwinnable situation if the final block is out of the paddle firing range)
- Learned the basics of the Unity platform, prefabs, scripts, and minimal particle effects.

What I would change:

- Fix sticky paddle bug
- Add notification of the power-up gained
- Fix window scaling and anchoring of number of balls
